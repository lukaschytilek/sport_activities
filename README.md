# sport_activities

Testing task 
 
The task goal is to create a simple mobile app which will record sport activities and store them in backend (in Firebase.com) or a local SQLite database. 
 
The app will consist of two fragments and one activity. The first fragment will be for entering sport activities. The second fragment will be for displaying previously entered sport activities. The activity will contain a Navigation Drawer which will enable switching between the fragments. Furthermore, the app will use the Material Design from the Android Support Library. The minimum supported Android version for the app is 4.1.
